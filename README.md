Minimal Shop — single-page demo

This repository now contains a small, sleek single-page e‑commerce demo called "Minimal Shop." It's designed
to be a simple, responsive prototype you can open locally in a browser. It intentionally does not include a
product filter feature — per the project request — and focuses on a clear product grid, product details,
and a simple cart + mock checkout flow.

Features
- Responsive product grid with sample items
- Product detail modal
- Add to cart, change quantities, remove items
- Cart drawer with total and a mock checkout that clears the cart

How to view
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or right-click -> Open With -> browser).
2. No build tools required. Everything is static (HTML/CSS/JS).

Notes
- This is a demo / prototype — there are no real purchases or backend integrations.
- There is no filter feature on the products.

If you want, I can:
- Add product categories (UI only) or a search box (not a filter).
- Move inline JS into a separate `script.js` file and add minimal tests.

Enjoy!
Brief from business

I have a couple of things on my list that I’ve been meaning to tackle, and I think one of them could work really
well: creating a prototype of a searchable strain catalogue for our website. At the moment we have a simple
marketing site, but no way for potential customers or partners to browse what we hold. Even if it’s just a
demo version with sample data, having a searchable catalogue with filters (e.g. by function, application, or
origin) would be hugely useful. It would also give the students a real-world challenge that combines design,
data structuring, and user experience.
