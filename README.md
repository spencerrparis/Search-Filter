Brief from business

I have a couple of things on my list that I’ve been meaning to tackle, and I think one of them could work really
well: creating a prototype of a searchable strain catalogue for our website. At the moment we have a simple
marketing site, but no way for potential customers or partners to browse what we hold. Even if it’s just a
demo version with sample data, having a searchable catalogue with filters (e.g. by function, application, or
origin) would be hugely useful. It would also give the students a real-world challenge that combines design,
data structuring, and user experience.
